<p>Trying to read the value contained in this <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm btn-cpptype" data-cpptype="std::future" href="" target="_self">std::future</a> can also help you wait until the HTTP query managed by this context has been entirely handled. At which point, the Context object will be destroyed: if you intend to safely interract with a Context object after the <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm btn-cpptype" data-cpptype="std::future" href="" target="_self">std::future</a> object has been read, make sure to keep an instance of <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm btn-cpptype" data-cpptype="std::shared_ptr" href="" target="_self">std::shared_ptr</a> alive, by using <code>context.shared_from_this()</code>.</p>
